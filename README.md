# Broaching Teeth Breakage Detection
The code is the result of research carried out for the development of an article titled "Tool Fracture Detection in Electromechanical Broaching Through Machine Sensor" that will be part of the "31st CIRP Conference on Life Cycle Engineering (LCE 2024)". This research presents the development of a virtual sensor designed for the real-time detection of tool fractures during the broaching process, allowing timely decision-making without generating greater damage to the part or tool. 

The virtual sensor is created using signals collected from the broaching machine data, without the need for external sensors; have the potential to improve product quality, increase process efficiency and reduce material waste as well as production costs by detecting tool fractures early and therefore increasing the overall sustainability of the process.
